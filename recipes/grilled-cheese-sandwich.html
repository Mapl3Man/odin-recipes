    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>There's Grilled Cheese and there's <strong>GREAT</strong> Grilled Cheese. Learn how to make the best Grilled Cheese Sandwich with a crisp, buttery exterior and gooey cheese center. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices Texas toast or thick sliced sandwich bread</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 slices medium Cheddar cheese	</li>
        <li> 4 slices Gouda cheese	</li>
        <li> 4 slices Havarti cheese	</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread 1/2 Tbsp of butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Set a skillet over medium/low heat and place 2 slices of bread in the skillet with the butter-side-down.</li>
        <li>Stack cheeses on one piece of toast: cheddar, havarti, then gouda. Once the breads are golden brown, closed the sandwich with the crisp sides on the outside.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until the bread is a rich golden brown, flipping once and press down lightly to help the bread stick to the cheese. Total cooking time should one 5-6 minutes. Keep the heat on medium low for the breads to toast slowly, giving your cheese a chance to fully melt and adhere to the bread.</li>
        <li>Once you see the cheese has melted and breads are browned, remove to a plate and cut in half diagonally to serve. Repeat with the next sandwich.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
